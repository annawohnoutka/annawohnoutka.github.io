          </div>
            <div>
                <p>Bellingham is often referred to as the city of subdued excitement, but I have a hunch that the people who gave it that title haven’t properly dabbled in Bellingham nightlife. From hippies and artists to adrenaline seekers, wallflowers, and live music connoisseurs —there is something for everyone—you just have to know where to look.
                I present to you the Beginner’s Guide to Bars in Bellingham.</p>

            <h3 class="h3">The Orion: Two Galaxies Walk into a Bar… </h3>
            <h4 class="h4">Cost: $</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>Start your night at The Orion, Bellingham’s beloved space-themed college bar! Named after the Orion Constellation, this cosmic bar is comprised of three dark rooms (one with pool), with neon lighting and constellations sprawling the walls.

                Other than the perfectly executed galactic theme, there is one thing you must know: the cocktails are c-h-e-a-p (six to seven dollars).  Orion boasts ten signature cocktails. Among them, The Gamma Ray, Cassiopeia, and Kelvin claim the title of most crowd-pleasing. Price and atmosphere combined; The Orion is the ideal corner of Bellingham to embark on your ascent into space—I’m not judging.
                
                The Orion is a quintessential stop for birthday bar hopping. The staff will give you an astronaut helmet and a ladle full of celestial alcohol to celebrate.

            <h4 class="h4">Cost: $$</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>For a State Street staple that allows you to linger and savor, look no further than Red Light Kitchen and Bar. Whether it’s a date night or a celebratory night out—you can’t miss Red Light’s eclectic vibe, drenched in a warm red glow, so reminiscent of a prohibition speakeasy that you’ll forget it’s 2021. 

                    The smorgasbord of drink offerings is well out of the ordinary: the menu boasts original cocktails that might have you looking up ingredients on google. I swear by the Heartbreaker, which has flavors of guava and strawberry, basil rum, fresh sour, creamy coconut, and Aperol-soaked strawberries all intermingling in one mason jar. Plus, don’t forget to order the tofu-ginger wontons to share with the table (or not!).

            <h4 class="h4">Cost: $$</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>Hidden away from the hustle and bustle of State Street, Honeymoon Alley Bar is a must if you are looking for a romantic and cozy hole-in-the-wall joint. Choose between candlelit indoor or outdoor fireside seating. The service is personal and genuine-- staff love to converse and will learn your name in no time. Go on Wednesday for open mic and live music, a fantastic opportunity to meet local artists and musicians. 

                    The menu features cider, cocktails, and most notably: Mead, which is wine made from honey, historically brewed for newlyweds to drink during their Honeymoon, hence the name. Not sure what to get? Consider a mead-tasting flight with the signature Lover’s Mead, Rhubarb, Blackberry, and beyond!

            <h3 class="h3">Cap Hansen’s Tavern: Funky Dive Bar for All Walks of Life</h3>
            <h4 class="h4">Cost: $-$$</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>Cap Hansen’s- colloquially known as Cap’s- is a funky dive bar if I’ve ever seen one. Cap’s on the smaller side and is usually crowded so be ready to make new friends with college kids or the local hippie regulars. Play some local music on the jukebox or admire the funky decorations. Also be ready to order their signature drop shot, the PBF, a creamy concoction tasting of the orange creamsicles you had as a kid… with a little something extra. 

                    Cap’s has free popcorn to ensure you won’t go hungry, or if you’re looking for something more substantial, venture across the street to Pye Hole, a walk-up window outside of La Fiamma, for some melt-in-your-mouth cheesy pizza. 
                    
                    Going here for a birthday? Make sure to order a shot on the house. The only caveat: the use of hands to take the shot is prohibited.

            <h3 class="h3">Black Sheep: Tequila for Days</h3>
            <h4 class="h4">Cost: $$</h4>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>I present to you, Bellingham’s Obsession: Black Sheep, situated on lively Holly Street. Established in 2016, this American-style tequila bar’s vivacious atmosphere, hand-pressed tortillas, and drinks will have you hooked in no time. Proceed with caution.

                    The nachos are downright magical and pair excellently with the Dude-a-rita, their signature drink. Plus, when you order a Dude-a-rita, Black Sheep donates a portion of their profits to LGBTQIA+, Latinx, and other organizations which aim to support minority communities.
                    
                    Sit inside, at the bar, or at outside booths complete with fireplaces and space heaters.
                    Run into a wait at Black Sheep? Try a daiquiri at Lorikeet, or get the signature boot of tequila at Cabin Tavern, while you wait.
